This is a code where i am making a mini shell.
first thing this code runs the normal commandes of linux like ls, pwd, date, clear.
and new commande its called exit from the name you know what what work it do, simply exit the code, this is the first update.
now i have finished it it can do alot of commandes, this code i used in it everything that i have learned in algorthems, the most commande i like is history, because i used linked-lists but in a good way i used a linked-list every node points to another linked-list the first on markes the nimbers of the commandes used in order and the other it nodes point to the characters of each commande in order.
this is a simple project but it was fun to work in.
